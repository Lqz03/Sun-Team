                        <p>Professor, School of Education of La Trobe University</p>
                        <p>For over 30 years Professor Therese Keane has been a champion for empowering girls in STEM. Her passion and many achievements have been acknowledged by her peers in her receiving numerous international, national and state awards. She has worked in a variety of school settings where she has taught IT and lead in K-12 education as the Director of ICT. Her Doctorate in Education focused on ICT Leadership in schools.
Therese's research and expertise lie at the intersection of ICT issues related to children, young people, teachers, parents, principals, ICT education, educational technologies, technological innovations, and gender in computing. Her work is interdisciplinary and theoretically robust but at its core is a concern with how various educational settings (early education, primary and secondary schools) and their stakeholders learn, use and teach with and about breakthrough technologies alongside new innovations, as well as the way it is negotiated, integrated and even, at times, resisted. In pursuing these research interests, she continues to investigate, several diverse avenues for research such as educational, humanoid, social robots; AI; computational thinking; computing education; children and programming; virtual reality and how these technologies are used by children and by extension educational stakeholders.
Therese has served on several State, National and International Boards including; Chair of Australian Computer Society's (ACS) ICT Educators Committee, Australian Council of Computers in Education (ACCE) and Australian Representative for the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP) Technical Committee on Education (TC3). Currently, she is the Chair for TC3 - WG3.3 - "Research into Educational Applications of Information Technologies". Therese is Deputy Editor for "Education and Information Technologies" - the official journal of the IFIP Technical Committee on Education covering the complex relationship between information and communication technologies and education. Throughout her career, Therese has also been an office holder in three professional teaching associations, the Victorian Information Technology Teachers Association (VITTA), Information and Communications Technology in Education Victoria (ICTEV) and the Digital Learning & Teaching Victoria (DLTV). Therese has presented numerous seminars and workshops for teachers involved in the teaching of Information Technology. She has written 18 textbooks in all units of VCE Senior Information Technology in Victoria since 1995 and has worked with the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) in the development of the VCE IT Study Design and various roles associated with VCE assessment over the past 25 years.
Therese has been involved in the provision of professional development to ICT teachers and research into the use of technology, gender inequalities in STEM based subjects, robotics in education and computers in schools for teaching and learning purposes. Therese has developed and delivered workshops in humanoid robot (NAO) for primary and secondary school students and was also involved with the FIRST LEGO League as Tournament Director for Victoria and lead mentor for the RoboCats – a schoolgirl only robotics team that participated in the FIRST Robotic Competition from 2014-2020.</p>
