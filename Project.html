                        <p>Description: In this project, we describe the background information of the proposed project, articulate the literature and rationales of the system development, as well as how to operate this project methodologically. Specifically, an interactive learning environment, namely, ScaffoldiaMyMaths with features of adaptive scaffoldings for mathematics problem solving and responsive assessment in the form of learning analytics is introduced. To explore the impact of ScaffoldiaMyMaths, experimental research design together with the pedagogical design of learning activities, will be conducted involving Grade 4, 5 and 6 primary students in Hong Kong. The statistical data analysis will be conducted on students mathematics achievement test, self-concept and motivation pre and post-tests for exposing the impact of scaffolding changes and scaffolding logic and the interaction effect between them on the changes of students learning performance. The beneficial impact of ScaffoldiaMyMaths on students with learning difficulties and typical achievers will also be compared for exposing the internal factors related to students performance. The study will not only fill the blank on technology-supported mathematics education for students with learning difficulties but also provide in-time facilitation for them to better adapt formal and informal learning contexts.</p>

                     <p>Description: This project strives to inspire students to apply digital creativity in their daily lives and nurture their proactive use of technologies for social good from a young age. The project aims to prepare students for a fast-changing digital future through a hands-on, minds-on, and joyful learning experience. An independent evaluation has found that students participated in the first pilot phase of the project grew twice as much in problem-solving skills when compared with non-participating students. Following the successful implementation of the four-year pilot, the second phase of the project is launched in 2020, with the aim of mainstreaming computational thinking education. </p>

T-surf 24/7 which is one of the focus areas under the "T-excel@hk" Project, is a one-stop portal that enables the teaching profession to have easy access to information on various professional development programmes offered by the Education Bureau (EDB), tertiary institutions and other educational bodies, as well as various e-learning resources and repositories for self-paced learning. While the "Pilot Scheme on Self-paced e-Learning Course Fee Reimbursement for Teachers" under T-surf 24/7 has been implemented since March 2018 to encourage teachers to participate in various kinds of e-learning courses or web-based seminars (webinars), the production of local tailor-made e-learning packages for in-services principals and teachers to further facilitate the paradigm shift of principals and teachers from traditional face-to-face lessons to on-line e-learning programmes. </p>

                     <p>Description: This project aims to enhance freshmen's learning engagement and outcomes in the General Education (GE) foundation course by incorporating formative e-assessment (FEA) tasks into the tutorial process. A teacher guide on FEA task design and implementation, FEA tasks, cases of using FEA tasks, and a relevant website will be developed and refined during the project. The GE foundation course is an important course aimed at cultivating undergraduates' generic skills for their future life and work. The effectiveness of the course depends on the level of student engagement and learning outcomes. FEA can enhance undergraduates' learning engagement and outcomes due to the nature of formative assessment and the relative affordance of technology. This project will adapt Salmon's five stage model to design and implement FEA tasks in tutorials. A quasi-experimental design will be utilized to collect data from at least 10 tutorial groups of the GE foundation course using the methods of survey, interviews and document analysis. The data will be used to evaluate the effects of FEA on learning and provide insights to formulate an FEA framework as a reference for assessment innovation in GE at the tertiary level. </p>
