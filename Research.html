                           <p>Abstract: This study explores the integration of drone technology into STEM education through the development and evaluation of the Drone Technology Enabled STEM Curriculum (DTESC). Grounded in “dronagogy”, a pedagogical framework that utilizes drones to enhance learning, DTESC effectively incorporates drone technology within science, mathematics, technology, and the humanities. The curriculum is structured to progress from multidisciplinary exploration to interdisciplinary integration, ultimately culminating in transdisciplinary applications. Sixteen Grade 9–10 students from a secondary school in Hong Kong participated in the study, engaging in activities such as designing drone-assisted water sampling systems and formulating entrepreneurial proposals for future applications. Employing mixed research methods, the study assessed the curriculum’s impact across cognitive, psychomotor, and affective learning domains. Results indicated high levels of student engagement and satisfaction, alongside significant improvements in psychomotor and affective skills. However, enhancements in cognitive learning outcomes, particularly in mathematics and programming, are necessary. This research offers valuable insights into the implementation of dronagogy to foster cross-disciplinary STEM education.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a design thinking teaching and learning model on students' design thinking skills in science class. The study utilised two projects, ‘Making a Simple Solar Water Heater’ and ‘Drawing a 3D Topographic Map of Zhejiang Province,’ based on the 5th-grade science curriculum in China, and involved 45 Grade-5 students from a primary school. The quasi-experimental repeated measure method was used to evaluate the students’ improvement in design thinking skills, with task-based pre-, mid-, and post-tests. Employing quantitative data analysis, the results showed significant improvement in students’ overall performance, with more pronounced improvement between the pre-test and post-test than between the pre-test and mid-test. The analysis of the seven design indexes of students’ design work demonstrated significant improvement in five indicators, except for ‘material’ and ‘shape.’ The study highlights the importance of incorporating design thinking into elementary school curricula to equip students with the necessary competencies for success in the twenty-first-century workforce.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: As technological advancements and internet accessibility expand, synchronous online teaching emerges as a valuable avenue in education, providing benefits for both educators and learners. Despite its potential, there is limited research in language education on leveraging synchronous online platforms to enhance students’ writing skills. This study addresses this gap by creating a synchronous online learning environment infused with corpus-based language pedagogy (CBLP) for university-level writing classes. A language teacher and 22 Social Sciences undergraduates participated in this project. Through a comprehensive analysis of the interview data from the teacher and students, and the online class interaction data, the study delves into factors influencing lesson effectiveness, examining both teacher and student perspectives on challenges faced. Furthermore, it discusses the pedagogical implications of these challenges, proposing solutions and adjustments to enhance the teaching and learning experiences associated with CBLP in a fully online educational environment.</p>

Effect of mind mapping-based scaffolding on elementary students’ computational thinking in block-based programming.

                           <p>Abstract: Block-based visual programming tools are widely used in elementary education. Nonetheless, these tools alone may not ensure the spontaneous and efficient acquisition of concepts and skills in computational thinking (CT). Using mind mapping as a form of scaffolding to facilitate the visualization of abstract thinking processes may enhance the effectiveness of programming instruction. This study therefore investigated the effects of mind mapping-based scaffolding that integrates five CT skills on elementary students’ CT development. Eighty-six fifth-grade students participated in our pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study. In the experimental group, mind mapping-based scaffolding was used to help students learn programming, while in the comparison group it was not used. The results showed that both groups achieved significant improvements in concept understanding and skill development; however, students instructed using mind mapping-based scaffolding obtained notably superior performance in understanding CT concepts and mastering CT skills. The results also revealed that the students had positive perceptions of mind mapping-based scaffolding, although challenges were also identified. This study enriches the relevant empirical research and offers insights for practitioners on designing effective scaffolding to promote students' CT development.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: This systematic review aims to offer a comprehensive analysis of recent empirical studies on technology-supported scaffoldings (TSS) within the education sector. A total of 31 TSS studies published between 2017 and 2022 were selected from the reputable databases. The analysis focuses on trends, research methods, intervention design, and student learning outcomes in TSS studies. The findings reveal that TSS applications encompass a diverse range of participants, subjects, pedagogical approaches, teaching strategies, and technological tools, impacting cognitive and affective domains. However, recent TSS research demonstrates a bias towards upper primary and junior secondary students, with a focus on science and language subjects. While established e-learning tools are commonly integrated into TSS designs, there is limited exploration of metacognitive and motivational scaffoldings. This study highlights the importance of dynamic scheduling and adjustment of TSS to cater to individual student needs and capabilities, laying the groundwork for future research to develop highly customized TSS that effectively support student learning.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: Universities, significantly impacted by the shift to online learning during pandemic, must critically evaluate their teaching methods and outcomes to enhance performance in the post-pandemic era. However, there has been a limited examination of whether students achieved comparable levels in cognition and social interaction during the pandemic compared to traditional face-to-face learning. Addressing this gap, this exploratory study utilized a quasi-experimental design to analyse and compare the learning performance and outcomes of two cohorts of students (totalling 45) in a 12-week university course delivered through the computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) approach, both during and after the pandemic. Employing quantitative analysis and lag sequential analysis, the study examined students' behaviours, similarities and differences in performance within CSCL environments under two distinct social situations. Results indicated that students engaged in complete online learning with CSCL and those in face-to-face teaching with CSCL achieved similar levels of conceptual understanding. Additionally, a comparable distribution pattern of learning behaviours was observed. However, significant differences in behaviour sequences emerged between the two implementations, with students exhibiting a higher level of engagement in CSCL activities during the post-pandemic period. These findings inform the design of CSCL environments should integrate student-centred activities and include guiding scripts, prompts and scaffoldings in navigating learning endeavours effectively.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: The laboratory plays a crucial role in science education. However, teacher education for pre-service teachers' design performance in the laboratory is still challenging. This study paved the way for redesigning traditional laboratory teaching into a student-centered approach: inquiry-based design thinking (IBDT). To investigate the impact of the IBDT approach on students' design performance of science experiments, 25 pre-service science teachers participated in a series of laboratory activities guided by the IBDT approach in a teacher education program in this study. Mixed research methods were employed to collect and analyze students' responses to pre- and post-surveys, their designed artifacts, and self-reflection reports. The overall positive results were obtained except for students' performance in art design, organization of the materials, and the gap between students'  understanding of theories and their practices/practical skills. The findings will inform the laboratory instruction in teacher education in science or science-oriented Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM) education.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: Blended learning, a pedagogical approach that seamlessly integrates online and offline teaching methods, has evolved into a pivotal component of higher education. In order to assess students’ perspectives on their experiences with blended learning in higher vocational schools, we developed a comprehensive tool known as the Blended Learning Perception Scale (BLPS). The scale’s reliability and validity have been rigorously substantiated through data obtained from 600 students enrolled in a vocational school in China. The creation of this scale primarily entailed the application of quantitative methodologies, including both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The final scale encompasses 24 items, categorizing student perceptions into five distinct factors: content coherence, interaction effectiveness, platform functionality, learning motivation, and learning satisfaction. Collectively, these factors elucidate 68.346% of the total variance. Moreover, the Cronbach’s coefficients (α) for these factors range from 0.791 to 0.842, denoting a high degree of internal consistency and thereby establishing the scale’s reliability. Item-based analysis further substantiates the scale’s reliability and discriminability, while confirmatory factor analysis unequivocally confirms its structural validity. Each factor’s average variance extracted (AVE) ranges from 0.589 to 0.671, with a cumulative value of 2.766. Additionally, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RSMEA) recorded at 0.053 underscores the scale’s satisfactory level of structural validity. In essence, this study presents a valid and dependable instrument for gauging students’ perceptions of blended learning, thoughtfully tailored to the specific attributes of higher vocational education and its students. Furthermore, it offers insights into areas that necessitate further enhancement within blended learning programs.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: In upper-secondary chemistry education, the concept of 'Amount of Substance' occupies a central position within the computation framework. However, comprehending this concept often poses a challenge for students. To address this issue, our study aimed to design and implement a computation skills test to assess the varying levels of students’ computation skills in understanding Amount of Substance. The test was administered to a total of 214 first-year students at the secondary schools. To analyse the test scores and unveil students’ comprehensive and mastery levels of computation skills, the SOLO Taxonomy was employed for scoring the levels. Additionally, interviews were conducted to identify the underlying reasons for their learning difficulties. Findings revealed that the majority of students demonstrated proficiency in solving relatively straightforward problems and applying basic formulas. Only a small fraction of students reached the advanced relational level, showcasing their ability to apply chemical concepts and methodologies to solve complex problems. Moreover, students exhibited varying degrees of proficiency when dealing with different types of knowledge and problems associated with computations involving solutions and the quantification of microscopic particles. Interviews uncovered students’ major learning difficulties. These findings inform the teachers’ teaching of Amount of Substance in chemistry education.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: This study aimed to develop a comprehensive diagnostic tool for assessing upper-secondary school students' understanding of isomers, expanding upon existing two- and three-tier conceptual diagnostic methods. By incorporating ‘Confidence Rating Factor’ tiers within the answer and reason sections, a four-tier test was designed and developed. This test was utilized to evaluate students’ comprehension of the isomeric conceptual framework and to identify prevalent misconceptions in terms of quantity, complexity, and typicality. The initial phase involved evaluating the reliability and content validity of the developed test before its distribution, resulting in a total of 385 effective test returned for analysis. Data analysis focused on descriptive statistics of students’ scores across each tier and dimension, supplemented by unstructured interviews to gain deeper insights. Results indicated a general suboptimal mastery of isomer conceptual understanding among upper secondary school students. Notably, students exhibited higher scores and confidence ratings in the answer tier compared to the reason tier. At both tiers, there was a significant positive correlation between scores and their confidence ratings. Further examination revealed varying levels of proficiency across different content dimensions, with students demonstrating the strongest grasp on the concept of isomers but facing challenges, particularly in ‘number judgment and writing’. The study identified eight misconceptions, classified as moderate, serious, and typical across four dimensions, offering valuable insights for teachers. These insights enable teacher to address students’ specific learning challenges related to isomers promptly and effectively, ultimately enhancing their understanding and mastery of the subject.</p>

Data from 399 kindergarten children, supplemented by parental insights, were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM). Positive parental attitudes toward outdoor activities were found to predict enhanced physical functioning and kindergarten performance. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed for social functioning, while emotional functioning remained unaffected. Parental attitudes directly influenced physical functioning, with indirect effects on kindergarten performance mediated by outdoor time and nature connections. These findings highlight the importance of parental attitudes in promoting children’s well-being and suggest potential strategies to enhance their health-related quality of life.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: The use of artificial intelligence has played an important role in science teaching and learning. The purpose of this study was to fill a gap in the current review of research on AI in science education (AISE) in the early stage of education by systematically reviewing existing research in this area. This systematic review examined the trends and research foci of AI in the science of early stages of education. This review study employed a bibliometric analysis and content analysis to examine the characteristics of 76 studies on Artificial Intelligence in Science Education (AISE) indexed in Web of Science and Scopus from 2013 to 2023. The analytical tool CiteSpace was utilized for the analysis. The study aimed to provide an overview of the development level of AISE and identify major research trends, keywords, research themes, high-impact journals, institutions, countries/regions, and the impact of AISE studies. The results, based on econometric analyses, indicate that AISE has experienced increasing influence over the past decade. Cluster and timeline analyses of the retrieved keywords revealed that AI in primary and secondary science education can be categorized into 11 main themes, and the chronology of their emergence was identified. Among the most prolific journals in this field are the International Journal of Social Robotics, Educational Technology Research and Development, and others. Furthermore, the analysis identified that institutions and countries/regions located primarily in the United States have made the most significant contributions to AISE research. To explore the learning outcomes and overall impact of AI technologies on learners in primary and secondary schools, content analysis was conducted, identifying five main categories of technology applications. This study provides valuable insights into the advancements and implications of AI in science education at the primary and secondary levels.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: The research paper explores the use of a metaverse-enabled immersive learning environment (MeILE) guided by the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework to enhance university student interactions and collaboration. The platform integrates various components, including avatar usage, multimodality, and gamification, with careful consideration of each CoI element to maximize students' immersive interactions and collaboration in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning contexts. By aligning activities with Bloom's digital taxonomy, the metaverse environment aims to improve STEM learning outcomes. A case study conducted at a university demonstrated the successful implementation of essential CoI elements, leading to increased student engagement and improved learning performance. Results indicate MeILE facilitates interactive, reflective, constructive, and self-regulated learning, which are essential for developing STEM and 21st century skills. The study emphasizes the teacher's role as a facilitator in fostering self-directed learning, and cultivating 21st-century skills through collaborative learning activities in virtual environment. The research underscores the importance of innovative educational tools in adapting to the evolving landscape of education in the digital age.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: Gamification, characterized by the integration of game design elements into non-game environments, has gained popularity in classrooms due to its potential for increased engagement and enjoyment compared to traditional lecture-based teaching methods. While students generally exhibit positive attitudes towards gamification, its impact on academic achievement remains a subject of debate. This study employed a meta-analysis approach to examine the overall influence of gamification on students' academic performance. The sample comprised 22 experimental studies conducted between 2008 and 2023, comparing the effects of gamified and non-gamified classes. Utilizing a random effects model, the results revealed a moderately positive effect of gamification on student academic performance (Hedges's g = 0.782, p < 0.05). The paper further discussed the outcomes of various moderator analyses, providing valuable insights into the selection and utilization of game design elements, as well as considerations specific to different educational stages. </p>

British Journal of Educational Technology, 55(6), 2740-2759. https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13478</a>
                           <p>Abstract: There is a global trend in the increased adoption of e-assessment in school classrooms to enhance learning. Teachers, as classroom-based assessment designers and implementers, play a vital role in such assessment change. However, little is known about school teachers' classroom-based e-assessment practices and the underlying reasons. To address this research gap, this study identified the factors influencing Hong Kong primary school teachers' e-assessment practices underpinned by the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). A large-scale survey was issued to 878 teachers via Qualtrics. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis shows that primary school teachers' intentions of using e-assessment and perceived behavioural control of it were the two strongest factors predicting their e-assessment practices in a general way. Specifically, teachers' intentions outweighed perceived behavioural control in determining their use of alternative e-assessment tasks and e-feedback, but this reversed for e-tests/exercises. The impact of perceived behavioural control was consistent across the three types of e-assessment practices. Furthermore, teachers' attitudes significantly influenced their intentions to use alternative e-assessment tasks, while subject norms primarily predicted their intentions to use e-feedback. The findings have implications for primary schools to take countermeasures to facilitate the successful implementation of e-assessment at the classroom level.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: Limited research has been conducted on the influence of computational thinking (CT) dispositions on students' mathematics performance and engagement at the secondary or junior high school level. This study aims to bridge this research gap by developing CT-integrated mathematics lessons that incorporate CT-focused problem-solving and modeling in mathematics education. The study was conducted in a secondary school in Singapore, where students engaged in a mathematics modeling task while learning the four pillars of CT. To investigate the impact of integrating CT dispositions on student engagement and mathematics performance, a one-group posttest design together with a survey was administered. Mixed research methods were employed. Structural Equation Modeling analysis revealed that CT dispositions could enhance students' mathematics performance by fostering greater engagement in math, although a direct effect of CT disposition on mathematics performance was not observed. Additionally, interviews with students highlighted their positive dispositions towards CT, including a sense of capability, inclination, and sensitivity in utilizing CT for the modeling task and other contexts.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: With the widespread use of Generative AI in education, effectively utilizing and integrating it into teaching have become key focal points and challenges in education. Different subjects and target audiences require varied norms and strategies for implementing Generative AI, such as ChatGPT. These differences directly impact the educational integration of Generative AI in various educational contexts. To address these disparities and establish common ground, we propose the concept of ChatGPT literacy to bridge research gaps. In this study, we tailor the concept of ChatGPT literacy specifically for language teachers, aiming to delineate the essential competencies needed to proficiently and ethically use ChatGPT as a language learning and teaching tool. We propose a theoretical framework encompassing six fundamental constructs: benefits, limitations, prompts, evaluation (of ChatGPT responses), assessment (assisted by ChatGPT), and ethics, to comprehensively conceptualise and evaluate ChatGPT literacy. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative survey data from 492 language teachers across 41 countries, we validate the proposed ChatGPT literacy framework by examining teachers' practices and challenges associated with ChatGPT usage. Our analysis of Likert-scale data, utilizing item and confirmatory techniques, confirms the effectiveness of the six-construct framework in defining ChatGPT literacy. In addition, we collected qualitative data through open questions and conducted thematic analysis, demonstrating that ChatGPT has been integrated throughout the instructional cycle, from material preparation to formative and summative assessment phases. These quantitative and qualitative findings have significant implications for a range of stakeholders, including language educators, learners, AI technology developers, and policymakers, providing valuable insights to inform decisions regarding ChatGPT integration in language education. Ultimately, our study equips relevant stakeholders with the necessary competencies to responsibly exploiting ChatGPT's potential in language and other subject areas.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: In the ever-evolving AI-driven education, integrating AI technologies into teaching practices has become increasingly imperative for aspiring STEM educators. Yet, there remains a dearth of studies exploring pre-service STEM teachers' readiness to incorporate AI into their teaching practices. This study examined the factors influencing teachers' willingness to integrate AI (WIAI), especially from the perspective of pre-service STEM teachers' attitudes towards the application of AI in teaching. In the study, a comprehensive survey was conducted among 239 pre-service STEM teachers, examining the influences and interconnectedness of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PE), and Self-Efficacy (SE) on WIAI. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed for data analysis. The findings illuminated direct influences of TPACK, PU, PE, and SE on WIAI. TPACK was found to directly affect PE, PU, and SE, while PE and PU also directly influenced SE. Further analysis revealed significant mediating roles of PE, PU, and SE in the relationship between TPACK and WIAI, highlighting the presence of a chain mediation effect. In light of these insights, the study offers several recommendations on promoting pre-service STEM teachers' willingness to integrate AI into their teaching practices.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: This study utilized the SEC (Survey of Enacted Curriculum) method to examine the alignment between Chinese high school chemistry curriculum standards (HSCCS) and the assessment of 'Chemical Reaction Principles' in the National College Entrance Examinations (NCEEs). The HSCCS and NCEEs were coded into two-dimensional matrices separately using SPSS, MATLAB, and EXCEL. The alignment coefficients were analyzed both macroscopically and specifically based on two dimensions: themes and cognitive levels. The findings indicated a generally low alignment between NCEEs and HSCCS in the 'Chemical Reaction Principles' domain, and no statistically significant alignment was observed. Comparing Porter alignment coefficients revealed a gradual increase in the overall alignment level between 2018-2022 NCEEs and HSCCS due to curricular reforms. Further specific analyses and comparisons highlighted significant discrepancies between NCEEs and HSCCS concerning themes and cognitive levels. Regarding themes, 'Ionic Reactions and Equilibrium in Aqueous Solutions' showed substantial alignment between NCEEs and HSCCS. However, for 'Application of Ionic Reactions and Equilibrium' and 'Systems and Energy,' NCEEs diverged significantly from or exceeded HSCCS requirements. Concerning cognitive levels, NCEEs demanded higher levels of student cognition compared to HSCCS.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to enhance visual cognition through virtual object experimentation and practice, while also fostering spatial skills relevant to mathematics. This experimental study was conducted with 86 sixth graders in Eastern China, involving a 3-month AR integrated Mathematics Curriculum (ARiMC), with pre- and post-tests administered. The analysis of spatial skills encompassed four dimensions: graphics recognition, movement, orientation, and measurement. The results revealed that there was no significant improvement in spatial skills with the experience of ARiMC. However, it’s noteworthy that ARiMC had a significant impact on the graphics movement dimension, particularly among female students. This finding suggests that AR-enabled learning is a convenient and effective teaching strategy compared to traditional methods, although it didn’t yield a broad enhancement in overall spatial skills. It demonstrates the capacity to improve certain abilities, particularly benefiting female students. This underscores the value of AR-enabled learning in mathematics education.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: Digital visualization technologies play a pivotal role in aiding students' comprehension of abstract concepts. This study addresses this critical need by creating a tailored stop-motion animation (SMA) aimed at rectifying students' misunderstandings concerning gas-collection activity. The development process spanned six phases, involving information collection, episode identification, storyboard construction, model creation, transformation of models into digital images, and the addition of narration to craft captivating animations. To evaluate the efficacy of this SMA on students’ conceptual understanding, data from the think-aloud method and written responses were gathered from a cohort of ten ninth grade students at a local junior secondary school. The findings were encouraging, underscoring the substantial role played by the customized SMA in facilitating students’ understanding of the structure of the multifunctional bottle, the properties of gases, and the gas flow in the gas-collection experiment. This study marks a promising stride in uncovering the potential of self-developed multimedia-based educational tools in chemistry education, paving the way for more effective and engaging learning environments.</p>

Reflective assessment using analytics and artifacts for scaffolding knowledge building competencies among undergraduate students.

                           <p>Abstract: Knowledge building (KB) competencies are crucial for undergraduates' creative knowledge work and academic success. While there is substantial research on KB discourse, there are limited efforts in examining how KB competencies in the conceptual, metacognitive, socio-emotional, and epistemic dimensions are demonstrated in KB discourse and how the competencies can be scaffolded. Previous studies suggest the effectiveness of reflective assessment on sustainable and productive KB discourse. This study developed a framework for analyzing KB competencies using KB discourse moves. It also examined whether a KB design augmented by reflective assessment enriched by analytic tools and artifacts could foster undergraduates’ KB competencies, and if so, how. This KB design involves principle-based pedagogy with the participants engaging in collaborative inquiry and discussion on Knowledge Forum, and reflective assessment using (a) super synthesis notes, (b) KB interaction rubrics, and (c) learning analytics visualization tools. Qualitative tracking and lag sequential pattern analysis of Knowledge Forum’s discourse revealed that implementing reflective assessment supported by analytics and artifacts could help the undergraduate students develop KB competencies manifested in discourse with evidence of conceptual advance, epistemic engagement, metacognition, and productive socio-emotional interactions with a collective focus. The thematic analysis illustrated the dynamics through which the design enriched by standards and visualizations helped the undergraduates develop KB competencies: leveraging synthesis super notes to promote conceptual and metacognitive advancement and epistemic engagement; employing KB interaction rubrics to cultivate metacognitive, socio-emotional, and epistemic competencies; and harnessing KBDeX visualizations to promote metacognitive and conceptual advancement and to facilitate epistemic engagement. The implications of scaffolding students’ epistemic agency, metacognition, productive collaborative inquiry, and developing KB competencies in a technology-supported metacognitive learning environment are discussed.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: Helping students gradually develop collective knowledge is critical but generally faces great challenges. Employing a quasi-experimental design, this study investigated the impacts and mechanisms of analytics-supported reflective assessment on the collective knowledge advancement of undergraduates. The experimental group (n=55) engaged in Knowledge Building inquiries with facilitation through analytics-supported reflective assessment, while the comparison class (n=38) pursued Knowledge Building inquiries facilitated by portfolio-supported reflective assessment. This study found that analytics-supported reflective assessment positively and significantly influenced undergraduates' collective knowledge advancement. Path analysis revealed the mechanisms of analytics-supported reflective assessment for supporting undergraduates’ collective knowledge advancement—the undergraduates’ metacognitive engagement and cognitive engagement influenced each other, further influencing their contribution to collective knowledge advancement and domain understanding. This study holds significant practical implications for fostering students' knowledge building, inquiry, and metacognition by designing technology-enhanced learning environments as collaborative and metacognitive tools. Additionally, the study offers insights into the processes and mechanisms of reflective assessment, contributing to an understanding of how it enhances students' development of higher-order skills.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: This interventional case study adopted a data-supported reflective assessment (DSRA) design to help pre-service teachers (PTs) engage in effective Knowledge Building (KB) and examined the mechanisms of this design to support PTs' productive KB discourse. The participants were 80 PTs from two classes taking the same course. Statistical analysis of indices from social network theory and content analysis of the participants' Knowledge Forum discourse revealed DSRA's positive influence on PTs’ KB discourse. Thematic analysis of the PTs’ prompt sheets, supplemented by analysis of classroom videos and classroom observations, revealed four mechanisms by which the DSRA fostered PTs’ KB: (1) identifying promising directions for further inquiry; (2) navigating data for extending collective focal ideas; (3) integrating separated keywords and identifying problems for further inquiry; (4) and improving “storylines” in the collective inquiry process and making numerical values meaningful. These findings extend the literature by revealing the mechanisms by which learners engage in productive shared regulation which are crucial for successful inquiry and KB. The findings also have significant implications for teacher educators and researchers seeking to design technology-enhanced learning to develop PTs' higher-level KB competencies.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has assumed an increasingly pivotal role in STEM education. However, a comprehensive review that captures the current landscape and research trends in this domain remains conspicuously absent. Purpose: In response, this study undertakes an exhaustive examination of 186 scholarly articles, all centered on the application of AI in STEM education.
Methods: This study used a bibliometric analysis to undertake an examination of the 186 articles. These articles, from the Web of Science Core Collections, spanned the time frame between 2013 and 2023.
Results and conclusion: This study found that: (1) the field had traversed two distinct phases, discernible in the annual publication trends—an initial exploratory phase followed by a rapid development phase; (2) the utilization of AI in STEM education unfolded along four key pathways: the refinement of exploratory STEM teaching through design principles, the seamless integration of emerging AI technologies into STEM education, the practical application of novel AI tools within STEM classrooms, and investigations into AI’s potential to enhance student motivation and academic performance in STEM disciplines; (3) 13 primary themes were identified, encapsulating diverse subjects ranging from early childhood education and 3D printing to the ARCS motivation model and collaborative learning strategies; and (4) relatively limited prevalence of long-term collaborations was identified, with research activities predominantly concentrated in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. This review serves as an essential resource for scholars. We also discuss the implications for educational practices, research, and policymaking within the STEM education landscape.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: This study extends the community of inquiry (CoI) framework and empowerment theory by exploring the relationships between motivational variables, CoI variables, learning presence, and empowerment. We added motivational beliefs (growth mindset, self-efficacy, and task value) as associated variables and learning presence (online self-regulation) as a mediator and examined their contribution to students’ cognitive presence and empowerment. The participants were 539 junior middle-school students in rural China who had acquired significant online learning experience as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that motivational variables were associated with students’ social presence and online self-regulation, which in turn related to their cognitive presence and empowerment in the online learning environment. Growth mindset and self-efficacy also exhibited a significant correlation with students’ cognitive presence. There was a positive correlation between cognitive presence and empowerment. We also found teaching presence has a positive association with social presence but a negative association with online self-regulation. Our research provides a more comprehensive explanatory model of online instruction and student empowerment by introducing the elements of motivational beliefs and learning presence to the CoI framework.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: Few studies have explored primary school teachers' classroom-based online assessment practices and underlying reasons. To fill this research gap, this study interviewed 48 Hong Kong primary school teachers to understand their online assessment practices and influencing factors when they were obliged to use it in their daily instruction under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings revealed that the participants tended to use online tests/exercises for formative purposes instead of summative purposes. In addition, they tried online alternative assessment tasks, such as video or audio recordings, peer assessment and projects, and gave online feedback to students but less frequently than online tests/exercises. The school examination culture and the participants’ perceived limited control over online test fairness may have restricted their summative use of online tests/exercises. Meanwhile, the participants’ perceived positive usage norms, along with their favourable attitudes towards and confidence in using online tests/exercises probably enhanced their formative use of them. In addition, the participants’ perceived neutral usage norms and limited external control of online alternative assessment tasks and feedback seemed to impede their use of them in classrooms.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: Under global public health emergencies such as COVID-19 and monkeypox, online learning for the second language (L2) has become prevalent, especially mobile learning, which provides a new training form spanning time and space for L2 learners in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Taking the turn construction of learners who learn Chinese as a second language (CSL) as a point cut, this study investigated L2 learners' communication strategies in a mobile learning context through conversation analysis, a qualitative method. The result showed that the CSL learner adopted self-turn construction, co-construction, and turn-taking in online communication. In turn-taking, the CSL learner raised the pitch at the beginning of a new turn to a position higher than the pitch at the end of the previous turn. This study revealed the structure and approach of CSL learners' turn construction in 'talk-in-interaction', enriching the theoretical research of turn construction under the transactional distance theory of L2 learning supported by mobile technologies.</p>

                           <p>Abstract:  Virtual laboratories are transformative tools in science education, yet comprehensive reviews of their prospects are limited. This study addresses this gap through a bibliometric analysis of 218 articles published between 2013 and 2023. Key findings included: (1) research has evolved from initial exploration to rapid expansion; (2) virtual labs have demonstrated adaptability across various scientific disciplines, including chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, and medicine; (3) five research trajectories focus on virtual labs, science education, and computer-based learning; and (4) eight research topics, such as comparisons with physical labs and student performance, have gained prominence. These findings had implications for educational practices, research methodologies, and policy considerations. For educational practices, virtual laboratories offer benefits by removing the need for physical resources, providing flexible delivery, enabling safe exploration, fostering engagement through hands-on experimentation, and enhancing understanding with immersive experiences. For research, virtual labs improve learning and analytical skills, generate detailed data on student behaviors and learning patterns, and lead to innovations in teaching methods and curriculum design. For policymakers, strategic planning is needed to create supportive policies for the effective adoption of virtual labs, including teacher training, infrastructure development, and curriculum integration, making science education more accessible and equitable for all students.</p>

                           <p>Abstract: Formative assessment has been long emphasised as a powerful means for enhancing science learning. However, there is still a lack of research to investigate the impacts of formative assessment on both students' motivational beliefs and behaviours in science learning. This study examined such impacts using data from six Western and six East Asian countries/economies in PISA 2015. 96,491 15-year-old students were included. The SEM analysis of overall data showed that (i) formative assessment had both direct effects on students’ science learning behaviours and indirect impacts mediated by students’ motivational beliefs and (ii) the total effect of teacher feedback on science learning behaviours was greater than adaptive instruction. The comparison between Western and East Asian datasets indicated that (i) the impact of teacher feedback on East Asian students’ motivational beliefs was greater than that on their Western counterparts, (ii) the impact of adaptive instruction on Western students’ motivational beliefs was greater than that on East Asian counterparts, and (iii) the direct impacts of teacher feedback and adaptive instruction on science learning behaviours were similar for both groups of students. Suggestions were made on how to effectively implement formative assessment to enhance science learning in different cultural contexts.</p>
