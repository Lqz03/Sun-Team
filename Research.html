                           <p>This study explores the integration of drone technology into STEM education through the development and evaluation of the Drone Technology Enabled STEM Curriculum (DTESC). Grounded in “dronagogy”, a pedagogical framework that utilizes drones to enhance learning, DTESC effectively incorporates drone technology within science, mathematics, technology, and the humanities. The curriculum is structured to progress from multidisciplinary exploration to interdisciplinary integration, ultimately culminating in transdisciplinary applications. Sixteen Grade 9–10 students from a secondary school in Hong Kong participated in the study, engaging in activities such as designing drone-assisted water sampling systems and formulating entrepreneurial proposals for future applications. Employing mixed research methods, the study assessed the curriculum’s impact across cognitive, psychomotor, and affective learning domains. Results indicated high levels of student engagement and satisfaction, alongside significant improvements in psychomotor and affective skills. However, enhancements in cognitive learning outcomes, particularly in mathematics and programming, are necessary. This research offers valuable insights into the implementation of dronagogy to foster cross-disciplinary STEM education.</p>

Exploring undergraduate students' learning experience and engagement in synchronous online teaching supported by corpus-based language pedagogy. https://doi.org/10.58459/rptel.2025.20018</a>
                           <p>As technological advancements and internet accessibility expand, synchronous online teaching emerges as a valuable avenue in education, providing benefits for both educators and learners. Despite its potential, there is limited research in language education on leveraging synchronous online platforms to enhance students’ writing skills. This study addresses this gap by creating a synchronous online learning environment infused with corpus-based language pedagogy (CBLP) for university-level writing classes. A language teacher and 22 Social Sciences undergraduates participated in this project. Through a comprehensive analysis of the interview data from the teacher and students, and the online class interaction data, the study delves into factors influencing lesson effectiveness, examining both teacher and student perspectives on challenges faced. Furthermore, it discusses the pedagogical implications of these challenges, proposing solutions and adjustments to enhance the teaching and learning experiences associated with CBLP in a fully online educational environment.</p>

                           <p>This systematic review aims to offer a comprehensive analysis of recent empirical studies on technology-supported scaffoldings (TSS) within the education sector. A total of 31 TSS studies published between 2017 and 2022 were selected from the reputable databases. The analysis focuses on trends, research methods, intervention design, and student learning outcomes in TSS studies. The findings reveal that TSS applications encompass a diverse range of participants, subjects, pedagogical approaches, teaching strategies, and technological tools, impacting cognitive and affective domains. However, recent TSS research demonstrates a bias towards upper primary and junior secondary students, with a focus on science and language subjects. While established e-learning tools are commonly integrated into TSS designs, there is limited exploration of metacognitive and motivational scaffoldings. This study highlights the importance of dynamic scheduling and adjustment of TSS to cater to individual student needs and capabilities, laying the groundwork for future research to develop highly customized TSS that effectively support student learning.</p>

                           <p>Universities, significantly impacted by the shift to online learning during pandemic, must critically evaluate their teaching methods and outcomes to enhance performance in the post-pandemic era. However, there has been a limited examination of whether students achieved comparable levels in cognition and social interaction during the pandemic compared to traditional face-to-face learning. Addressing this gap, this exploratory study utilized a quasi-experimental design to analyse and compare the learning performance and outcomes of two cohorts of students (totalling 45) in a 12-week university course delivered through the computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) approach, both during and after the pandemic. Employing quantitative analysis and lag sequential analysis, the study examined students' behaviours, similarities and differences in performance within CSCL environments under two distinct social situations. Results indicated that students engaged in complete online learning with CSCL and those in face-to-face teaching with CSCL achieved similar levels of conceptual understanding. Additionally, a comparable distribution pattern of learning behaviours was observed. However, significant differences in behaviour sequences emerged between the two implementations, with students exhibiting a higher level of engagement in CSCL activities during the post-pandemic period. These findings inform the design of CSCL environments should integrate student-centred activities and include guiding scripts, prompts and scaffoldings in navigating learning endeavours effectively.</p>

                           <p>The laboratory plays a crucial role in science education. However, teacher education for pre-service teachers' design performance in the laboratory is still challenging. This study paved the way for redesigning traditional laboratory teaching into a student-centered approach: inquiry-based design thinking (IBDT). To investigate the impact of the IBDT approach on students' design performance of science experiments, 25 pre-service science teachers participated in a series of laboratory activities guided by the IBDT approach in a teacher education program in this study. Mixed research methods were employed to collect and analyze students' responses to pre- and post-surveys, their designed artifacts, and self-reflection reports. The overall positive results were obtained except for students' performance in art design, organization of the materials, and the gap between students'  understanding of theories and their practices/practical skills. The findings will inform the laboratory instruction in teacher education in science or science-oriented Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM) education.</p>

Development and validation of a blended learning perception scale for higher vocational students.

                           <p>Blended learning, a pedagogical approach that seamlessly integrates online and offline teaching methods, has evolved into a pivotal component of higher education. In order to assess students’ perspectives on their experiences with blended learning in higher vocational schools, we developed a comprehensive tool known as the Blended Learning Perception Scale (BLPS). The scale’s reliability and validity have been rigorously substantiated through data obtained from 600 students enrolled in a vocational school in China. The creation of this scale primarily entailed the application of quantitative methodologies, including both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The final scale encompasses 24 items, categorizing student perceptions into five distinct factors: content coherence, interaction effectiveness, platform functionality, learning motivation, and learning satisfaction. Collectively, these factors elucidate 68.346% of the total variance. Moreover, the Cronbach’s coefficients (α) for these factors range from 0.791 to 0.842, denoting a high degree of internal consistency and thereby establishing the scale’s reliability. Item-based analysis further substantiates the scale’s reliability and discriminability, while confirmatory factor analysis unequivocally confirms its structural validity. Each factor’s average variance extracted (AVE) ranges from 0.589 to 0.671, with a cumulative value of 2.766. Additionally, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RSMEA) recorded at 0.053 underscores the scale’s satisfactory level of structural validity. In essence, this study presents a valid and dependable instrument for gauging students’ perceptions of blended learning, thoughtfully tailored to the specific attributes of higher vocational education and its students. Furthermore, it offers insights into areas that necessitate further enhancement within blended learning programs.</p>

                           <p>In upper-secondary chemistry education, the concept of 'Amount of Substance' occupies a central position within the computation framework. However, comprehending this concept often poses a challenge for students. To address this issue, our study aimed to design and implement a computation skills test to assess the varying levels of students’ computation skills in understanding Amount of Substance. The test was administered to a total of 214 first-year students at the secondary schools. To analyse the test scores and unveil students’ comprehensive and mastery levels of computation skills, the SOLO Taxonomy was employed for scoring the levels. Additionally, interviews were conducted to identify the underlying reasons for their learning difficulties. Findings revealed that the majority of students demonstrated proficiency in solving relatively straightforward problems and applying basic formulas. Only a small fraction of students reached the advanced relational level, showcasing their ability to apply chemical concepts and methodologies to solve complex problems. Moreover, students exhibited varying degrees of proficiency when dealing with different types of knowledge and problems associated with computations involving solutions and the quantification of microscopic particles. Interviews uncovered students’ major learning difficulties. These findings inform the teachers’ teaching of Amount of Substance in chemistry education.</p>
